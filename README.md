## Overview
A web-based 3D pool table simulator featuring realistic physics and interactive gameplay. Built with **Three.js** for 3D rendering and **Cannon.js** for physics simulation.

## Features

### 🎨 Visual Components
- **3D Pool Table**: Realistic table design with cushions and pockets.
- **Pool Balls**: Standard billiard balls with smooth physics.
- **Cue Stick & Aiming Line**: Helps players visualize shot direction.

### 🎯 Physics & Gameplay
- **Realistic Ball Physics**: Collision, rolling, and pocket detection using **Cannon.js**.
- **Power Control**: Adjustable shot power using the space bar.
- **Cue Ball Reset**: Option to manually reposition the cue ball if pocketed.
- **Collision Response**: Friction and bounce behavior mimicking real-world billiards.

### 🎮 Interactive Features
- **Mouse Controls**: Aim with the mouse and shoot using the space bar.
- **Orbit Camera**: Free movement around the table for a better view.
- **New Game Button**: Restart the game at any time.
- **Ball Pocketing**: Balls are removed when they enter a pocket.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights
- **Three.js** for rendering the 3D environment.
- **Cannon.js** for physics simulation.
- **Procedural Geometry**: Table and cushions dynamically generated.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Shadows and reflections for a realistic feel.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices.

## 🎓 Use Cases
- Learning the physics of billiards.
- Practicing shot angles and collision response.
- Creating an interactive pool simulation for education or fun.

## 🔧 Implementation Details
- **Table & Pockets**: Custom modeled with procedural geometry.
- **Collision Handling**: Contact materials for realistic ball behavior.
- **Power & Aiming System**: Adjustable shot strength and trajectory visualization.
- **Game Logic**: Automatic ball pocketing and cue ball reset system.

## 🌐 Browser Support
- Compatible with modern browsers supporting WebGL.
- Works on both desktop and mobile.
